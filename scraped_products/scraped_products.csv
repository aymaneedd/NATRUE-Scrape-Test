APRICOT KERNEL SKIN CARE OIL,Solling Naturkosmetik,Organic cosmetics,Ölmühle Solling GmbH,"Ingredients
Prunus Armeniaca kernel Oil* 
     *of controlled biological cultivation

Description
The organic apricot kernel oil by Solling Naturkosmetik is a regenerating skin care for face and body. The rich skin care oil has a mild and natural fragrance of apricot kernel and is rich in oleic and linoleic acid. It has a light texture and absorbs well into the skin, without leaving a greasy skin feel. The mild oil leaves a soft skin and is also suitable for baby care.

Usage
 - Apricot kernel oil for sensitive skin care:
Our apricot kernel oil is free from fragrances and essential oils and helps dry skin to keep moisture for a long period of time. In addition, it is very tolerable and protects the sensitive skin of face and bust. Futhermore, apricot kernel oil contains natural antioxidants, neutralises free radicals and has an anti-aging effect.

Our skin care oils pamper the skin and are ideal for the daily skin care of the face and the body. Our apricot kernel oil fuses with the skin's lipid layer and supplies the skin with vitamins, essential fatty acids and phytochemicals. Our skin care products are all natural - because we are convinced that nature has everything to offer that our skin needs.

 - Apricot kernel oil as make-up remover
Pure apricot kernel oil can be used as make-up remover and is even suitable for water-proof make-up. Simply moisten a make-up removal pad with warm water, add a little apricot kernel oil and gently stroke over skin, lips or eyelashes. Make-up removal pads made of bamboo or organic cotton are reusable and protect our environment.

 - Mix & Match:
Individual and unique: Every skin is different and so are its needs. Therefore, all of our skin care products can be mixed to match your individual needs. Apricot kernel oil can either be enhanced with other skin care oils or our skin balms or even be combined with creams and lotions. Just add a few drops to your face cream for more skin elasticity and extra moisture.

 - Face or body scrubs with skin care oils:
Skin scrubs can help the skin to regenerate and unclog the pores. Making your own scrub with apricot kernel oil at home is very easy: Simply mix sea salt, coconut flower sugar, almond meal or coffee grounds (depending on the desired grain) with the oil, gently apply the mixture in circular movements and rinse with lukewarm water. This way, dead cells are removed and the skin is vitalised and pampered. We recommend to use body scrubs in the shower."

Description
Our deodorant stick works effectively with just five ingredients. It inspires with a fine scent of coconut without the addition of essential oils, colorings and preservatives. It offers the perfect care for the sensitive and fine armpit skin - especially after shaving.

Pure nature helps against unpleasant odours: baking soda creates an alkaline environment in which bacteria can only multiply poorly, coconut oil has an anti-inflammatory and antibacterial effect with the lauric acid it contains and is the fragrant component in our deodorant stick.

Our pure Nilotica shea butter nourishes the armpit skin and makes it soft and supple. Moringa seed oil has an odor-neutralizing and antibacterial effect.

Sunflower wax keeps the deodorant stick in shape even in summer temperatures. We use an unscented sunflower wax."
