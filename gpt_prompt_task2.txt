Write a Python script to process raw material data extracted from the NATRUE website and structure it similarly to the material pages on CommonShare (e.g., Alpaca: https://www.commonshare.com/materials/alpaca).

Requirements:
✅ Extract all individual raw materials from the INCI field.  
✅ Ensure each material is structured like a CommonShare material page with sections:
   - **Overview (Description)**
   - **History**
   - **Applications & Uses**
   - **Manufacturing Process**
   - **Certifications & Standards**
   - **Manufacturer & Country of Origin**
   - **Scientific & Environmental Properties**
   - **Brands Using This Material**
   - **Manufacturers Producing This Material**  
✅ Ensure standards and countries are 100% correct using:
   - Manufacturer-country mapping from the scraped brands dataset.
   - Verification of certifications and expiration data.
✅ Store each material as a separate document in docx document.
