Amala uses whole plants, rather than isolated plant ingredients, to preserve their unique healing benefits, nurturing properties and maximum efficacy. \n\n- 100% Natural – free of petrochemicals, parabens and genetically-modified ingredients. Products contain a proprietary blend of organic plants and compounds that have natural preservative properties, yielding a shelf life of 24 months. \n\n- Custom distillation and extraction – each plant ingredient is extracted according to its specific composition by master distillers who respect this time-honored tradition. This method preserves each plant’s intrinsic healing properties for the skin. \n\n- 100% organic and food grade emulsifiers - ensure absolute purity and safety for both users and the environment. \n\n- No unnecessary ingredient processing – no bleach, deodorizing, refining or gamma radiation. Each plant maintains its original attributes throughout the product development process in order to keep plant properties as pure and effective as in nature itself. \n\n- Fair trade and ethical sourcing – Amala pays a fair price for superior plant ingredients and sources them exclusively from their sustainable farm partners and trusted suppliers around the world. Additionally, five percent of profits are returned to these local communities to help them preserve their culture and achieve long-term economic sustainability. \n\n- 100% natural fragrance - the aroma of pure essential oils and flower extracts.

Thus, serene life energy.  Amanprana is a range of products that supports and strengthens our life energy serenely without harming our body or mind. In short: gently and without excess. \n\nAmanprana does not believe in the ‘magic pill’. Amanprana is always organic and vegetarian. Attention is also paid to healthy ecological packaging. We prefer glass over plastic, as it is better for the environ ment, your health and the taste. Whenever possible we print with vegetable inks and on ecological paper. \n\nAt Amanprana we believe in the whole and not in the separate parts. Our products are therefore processed as little as possible and we do not use isolates. Isolates are chemically or naturally fabricated isolated substances that will never be capable of equalling the whole. We do not, for example, add isolated vitamin E but use red palm and wheat germ oil as rich natural sources of vitamin E. \n\nAt Amanprana we are aware of Hippocrates’ wise words: ‘Let nutrition be your medicine and medicine your nutrition.’"
