Amala’s formulation standards include: 

- Certified organic formulas, whole plant ingredients – grown in their ideal habitats to ensure their peak potential, and certified organic by NATRUE – the Brussels-based, non-profit organization, aims to safeguard the highest global standards for natural cosmetics. Amala uses whole plants, rather than isolated plant ingredients, to preserve their unique healing benefits, nurturing properties and maximum efficacy. 

- 100% Natural – free of petrochemicals, parabens and genetically-modified ingredients. Products contain a proprietary blend of organic plants and compounds that have natural preservative properties, yielding a shelf life of 24 months. 

- Custom distillation and extraction – each plant ingredient is extracted according to its specific composition by master distillers who respect this time-honored tradition. This method preserves each plant’s intrinsic healing properties for the skin. 

- 100% organic and food grade emulsifiers - ensure absolute purity and safety for both users and the environment. 

- No unnecessary ingredient processing – no bleach, deodorizing, refining or gamma radiation. Each plant maintains its original attributes throughout the product development process in order to keep plant properties as pure and effective as in nature itself. 

- Fair trade and ethical sourcing – Amala pays a fair price for superior plant ingredients and sources them exclusively from their sustainable farm partners and trusted suppliers around the world. Additionally, five percent of profits are returned to these local communities to help them preserve their culture and achieve long-term economic sustainability. 

- 100% natural fragrance - the aroma of pure essential oils and flower extracts. No animal testing - in fact, Amala has limited its ingredient dossier to those which have been cleared of animal testing since 1979."

THE AMANPRANA PHILOSOPHY 

In Sanskrit, the classical Indian written language, ‘aman’ means peace or rest and ‘prana’ refers to life energy. Thus, serene life energy.  Amanprana is a range of products that supports and strengthens our life energy serenely without harming our body or mind. In short: gently and without excess. 

Amanprana does not believe in the ‘magic pill’. Amanprana is always organic and vegetarian. Attention is also paid to healthy ecological packaging. We prefer glass over plastic, as it is better for the environ ment, your health and the taste. Whenever possible we print with vegetable inks and on ecological paper. 

At Amanprana we believe in the whole and not in the separate parts. Our products are therefore processed as little as possible and we do not use isolates. Isolates are chemically or naturally fabricated isolated substances that will never be capable of equalling the whole. We do not, for example, add isolated vitamin E but use red palm and wheat germ oil as rich natural sources of vitamin E. 

At Amanprana we are aware of Hippocrates’ wise words: ‘Let nutrition be your medicine and medicine your nutrition.’"

The three most important elements behind the brand GreenEtiq:

1. My passion for good business cases & the cosmetic industry, which to me is a constant quest or High Quality for a reasonable money. With my insight into and experience with the cosmetics world, I want to make it possible, to offer an ecological & natural based assortment, of the highest quality, for reasonable money. A brand where the ethics are high, an honest brand where you can rely on claims and markting. 

2.  ”If you can not stand eating it, then it won´t be healthy for your skin”. The increased awareness of living healthy, - not  feeding your body, either on the outside or the inside, which is not good for it. 

3. Taking care of our environment, so that our dearest owner, the descendants of all of us, have an equally beautiful, green  and wonderful world, in the future, as we have today. Personally, I Iove to move around in the nature, whether it is summer or winter, I have daily walking or cycling trips with the family and/or with our dear dog, or on horseback. 

Hoping very much, that you will enjoy GreenEtiq Denmark, feel the nature and the effective effect, just as much as I do myself.

The brand Kneipp® is based on the knowledge of the German priest Sebastian Kneipp. He focused intensively his entire life on the effects of water and plants. Over the years, he expanded his knowledge into a systematic philosophy with the 5 pillars of water, plants, exercise, nutrition and balance. Kneipp created such a holistic concept of life that the person, his/her lifestyle habits and his/her natural environment are inextricably considered to be a balanced unit.

In 1891, he placed his knowledge in the hands of a friend, the pharmacist Leonhard Oberhäußer, and transferred the rights to him to produce and market goods ""with the name and image of Father Sebastian Kneipp."" This laid the foundation for the Kneipp® brand. 

Nowadays, Sebastian Kneipp's philosophy is more current than ever - and the Kneipp® experts ensure that the 125 years of expertise in nature are relevant today. The traditional brand Kneipp® stands for effective, innovative and natural product concepts for well-being and health based on the holistic teachings of Sebastian Kneipp."

Quarnero cosmetic
Traditional & organic cosmetic 

Gift of the earth, sun and sea...

Unique products are a combination of organic extra virgin sesame oil, Fleur de Sel from the Adriatic Sea and essential oils from traditional and carefully selected micro-locations of organic origin. A hand-made mixture of natural ingredients has been selected with care for the optimal effect of Quarnero products: Body care oils , Bath salt and Wellness and spa products. 

Tradition 
Quarnero's story and products fit perfectly with the tradition of the Kvarner region which dates back to 1885 and Andrija Lindarić's distillery on the island of Cres. The reputation of the oils produced at the time reached even America. The benefits of sage, immortelle, laurel, fennel and lavender from one of the best micro-locations in the world have enjoyed world-wide recognition throughout history. This tradition continues with the enthusiasm and love of the Quarnero's team. According to the alchemists, each disease can be cured by a particular plant. Therefore, Quarnero's philosophy is to help a modern life style to realize the importance of getting back to nature and the use of plants. 

Quarnero's approach gives priority to health, however it does not disregard the aesthetic component. 

All products: 
- Are certified by prestigious NATRUE certificate for organic and natural products 
- Are suitable for Vegans and are registered by Vegan Society 
- Contain cold pressed extra virgin organic oils 
- Contain plants from biodynamic and organic cultivations and wild plants 
- Contain top quality 100% pure and natural essential oils 
- The ingredients are not tested on animals 
- The finished products are not tested on animals 
- No use of genetically modified plants 
- Production processes in accordance with strict ecological standards
- Packaging material is entirely biodegradagle and recyclable 

Love, positive intention and joy have accompanied the creation and the production of our products."
